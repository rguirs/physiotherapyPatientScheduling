# physiotherapyPatientScheduling
A simple program to address a problem from a doctoral student of physiotherapy who needs to schedule sessions (considering several constraints) for a research


The greedy algorithm works and can handle English and Portugues as input/output.
Some characteristics of the problem are "hardcoded". It is expected that soon some of them are going to be set as parameters
I hope to implement a mathematical model later.

If you are researching a similar problem, feel free to send me a e-mail so we can share different formulations and methods

Thanks :)
